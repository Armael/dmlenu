        <p>We are all users of dmenu, but we find that some features were
        underexploited, or completely missing :
        <ul>
            <li>dmenu_run is a fine (shell) script, but since dmenu completes
            only in the list of candidates it took from stdin you can never have
            completion on program arguments.</li>
            <li>when you configure te window to span on several lines,
            candidates are now displayed one per line, nothing more. (to be
            fair, what else could there be?)</li>
        </ul>
        Dmlenu improves on these two points in several ways :
        <ol>
            <li>A completion candidate is now a tuple instead of just a string.<br>
            The tuple consists of 3 strings, a "display" which is what will be
            shown to the user, a "real" which is what your application will
            retrieve once the completion is done, and a "doc" field (more on
            that later).
            An example for the interest display/real is the case of files: the
            display is the filename, the real is its absolute path.
            </li>
            <li>The candidate are not (only) coming from stdin anymore. Dmlenu
            is library, as such you can specify arbitrarly many sources, and
            transitions between them.
            You can also specify sources which run some kind of analysis on the
            current input to provide better candidates.</li>
            <li>As long as the user hasn't hit enter, the completion continues.
            So once the user has "completed" an item (i.e. hit tab, or space
            after a complete name) the "transition" function which we talked
            about earlier will be called and provide a new source.<br>
            You can for example decide that if the input is "chrome" the new
            candidates will be your browsers bookmarks (display = bookmark name,
            real = url!)</li>
            <li>When the window spans on several lines, we also show a candidate
            (its display) per line, but also show the "doc" field.
            That's not much of an improvement, but we have some ideas for future
            development.</li>
        </ol></p>

        <p>Oh and did I mention that dmlenu is a library?<br>
        You can in just a few line of codes design the application that better
        fits <em>your</em> needs : you can dynamically change the number of
        lines depending on the source, you can change the matching function
        (strict, fuzzy, you name it), etc.</p>

        <p>It is developped in OCaml and available on Github (link in the
        header).<br></p>

        Just a quick screencast to show you the features of dmlenu (and how its
        usage differs from dmenu) :
