- Allow use of arrows to browse through candidate.
    (note: the way dmenu does that works well.)

- Selection should return the current input, it shouldn't complete beforehand.

- Add "loose" matching functions

- Handle spaces in candidates names.
  i.e. we should know that "~/my directory/" is a single element, not two
  ("~/my" "directory/").

- Use Lwt: [Dmlenu.run] could return a [string option Lwt.t]
