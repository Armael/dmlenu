- Improve candidate "browsing"
  i.e. when using arrows, we always make the "first" candidate disappear,
       instead we could go "to the end of the screen" before making anything
       disappear.

- Use Lwt: [Dmlenu.run] could return a [string option Lwt.t]

- Prioritize complete matches in candidate list (i.e. they should come first).
  Indeed when using fuzzy matching, "foo.ml" matches ".foo.ml.swp", "foo.ml" and
  "foobar.ml".
  In this example ".foo.ml.swp" will come first (because '.' < 'f'), it would
  probably be better if "foo.ml" was the first suggestion.
