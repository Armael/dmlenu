- Allow use of arrows to browse through candidate.
    (note: the way dmenu does that works well.)

- Selection should return the current input, it shouldn't complete beforehand.

- Add "loose" matching functions

- Handle spaces in candidates names.
  i.e. we should know that "~/my directory/" is a single element, not two
  ("~/my" "directory/").

- Invert "control flow": instead of calling [Draw.run] which loops until the
  user quits or confirm his selection, we should call a "next_keyboard_event"
  function of type "unit -> keysym Lwt.t" (or a blocking version without Lwt).
